                <p>
                    In basketball, a jump ball can mean different things depending on which league you're paying
                    attention to, but they all have one thing in common: it is used to start games. This is called the
                    opening tip-off, where an official tosses the ball in the air between two opposing players, who then
                    jump at the ball to win possession for their team. At many levels excluding the NBA, a jump ball is
                    called when a tie-up occurs between opposing players, and a possession arrow determines who will get
                    the ball. In the NBA, a jump ball between the two players means they will perform the same act that
                    opens the game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The jump ball is simultaneously one of basketball’s oldest traditions and one of its most curious
                    regular events. Each jump ball is its own game-within-a-game, at once a primal contest of athletic
                    prowess and a constantly evolving game of chicken between players and refs—and among jumpers
                    themselves. There’s at least one jump ball in every single NBA contest, and most have a limited
                    impact on the winner; rare exceptions, though, come at huge moments and can swing games.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And in today’s modern, increasingly standardized game—especially where referees are concerned—the
                    jump ball is also a persistent vestige of a bygone era. It’s among the last true Wild West frontiers
                    in basketball, marked by the same foggy rule interpretations, quirky styles, and sense of
                    lawlessness that characterized the first jump balls ever thrown.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How has the jump ball endured for more than a century? How have Shaq and other elite practitioners
                    bent and even broken the rules to gain an edge, and do referees have enough tools and incentives to
                    stop them? Will the jump ball always be a central part of the NBA game? Should it?

                "There are different strategies for how you can get an advantage ... . And a lot of it depends on the
                ref and how they throw it. You can prepare all day, but if they throw it slightly to the other side, the
                advantage is immediately gone."
